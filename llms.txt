# Anki Audio Normalizer

> Anki Audio Normalizer is a Ruby script that helps normalize audio volume levels in Anki flashcard collections using ffmpeg and ffmpeg-loudnorm-helper.

Anki Audio Normalizer solves the problem of inconsistent audio volume levels in language learning flashcards. The tool processes audio files in an Anki collection to normalize them to a consistent loudness level, making the learning experience more pleasant without constantly adjusting volume.
